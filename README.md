wireless Temperature sensor using PIC16F877A &amp; GSM module SIM900D

Wireless temperature sensor using gsm and microcontroller is designed to measure temperature from remote location and then send it to any where you want on your mobile through SIM900D gsm module.PIC16F877A microcontroller is used to measure temperature from LM35 temperature sensor and then microcontroller is interfaced with SIM900D gsm module to send temperature through sms to a recipient. You can also also use more than one sensors to measure other physical parameters from remote location and then send them to any number you want.

In circuit diagram temperature sensor can be located at remote location and you can connect more than one sensor like light sensor, motion sensor ,pressure sensor according to requirement of your project. Lcd is use optional. Gsm module is used to send sms to any mobile number.you can also use other wire less communication source like Bluetooth if distance is not more than 5 meter.This project have many applications in remote monitoring systems.you can change it with ease according to your specifications.
